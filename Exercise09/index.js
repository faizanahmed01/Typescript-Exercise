//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, 
//but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
//The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
let names = ["Hassan", "Ahmed", "Arsalan", "Farhan",];
//Using for loop you just print a message
for (let name of names) {
    console.log(`Hi ${name}, I am learning typescript`);
}
export {};
